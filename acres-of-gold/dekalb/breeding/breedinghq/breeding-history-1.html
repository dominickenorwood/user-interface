                <h4>Plant breeding has been practiced for thousands of years, since near the beginning of human civilization, in order to produce the most productive crops for food supply.</h4>
                <p>Plant breeding is the art and science of changing plant genetics in order to produce desired characteristics like volume of yield, nutrition, taste and more. The earliest farmers who domesticated crops were the original plant breeders. They visually assessed plants to identify the best ones for producing the next crop, which was neither a fast nor highly effective process for improving yields.</p>
                <p>Through the lens of breeding, many developing sciences came together in the first half of the 20th century to shape the future of crop improvement.</p>

                                <p>Early studies discovered heterosis, the increased general health and performance of an offspring plant from parents with very different genetic compositions. Studies on the effects of inbreeding and crossbreeding to highlight hybrid vigor led to the development of hybrid corn as the standard practice for production.</p>
