Typically, 4- to 5-inch-wide strips are cleared and approximately 4-inch-tall berms are built in the fall while fertilizer is applied below the surface. Strip-till operations can also be conducted in the spring, however, a rolling basket is likely needed to crumble clods and firm the seedbed behind the unit prior to planting. Applying fertilizer in close proximity to the seed can also be risky due to increased chances for seedling injury or death.</p>
