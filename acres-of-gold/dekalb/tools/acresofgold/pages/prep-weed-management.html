                            <p>Effective weed management is imperative to protect crop yield and profit potential. An effective weed control program should start with pre-plant and/or preemergence applications that include soil residual herbicides to provide long-lasting, residual weed control. The potential impacts of weed competition are significant; studies show that if left uncontrolled, 12-inch weeds could cause 22&#37; yield loss in corn.</p>
