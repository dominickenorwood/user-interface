                                                Winter annuals are best controlled by herbicide applications made in the late fall, prior to very cold conditions.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The later a residual herbicide is applied in the fall, the longer the herbicide will remain effective in the spring.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Herbicides with different modes of action should be applied to reduce the risk of herbicide resistance.

                                        <li> Include ammonium sulfate (AMS) with any treatment that includes glyphosate. Refer to all herbicide product labels for the inclusion of a surfactant or crop oil concentrate. </li>
                                        <li> Do not apply a late-fall herbicide application directly after crop harvest. Allow time for crop residue to settle to help maximize herbicide contact to weeds. </li>
                                      	<li>If you have utilized an organophosphate (OP) soil insecticide (such as Counter&reg;, Lorsban&reg;, Fortress&reg; or Aztec&reg;) as a part of your corn rootworm management plan, special care should be taken in building a complementary weed management plan to reduce potential risks of adverse interactions and subsequent crop injury.</li>
