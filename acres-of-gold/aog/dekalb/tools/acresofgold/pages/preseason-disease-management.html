											<p style="margin-top:30px;font-size:16px;text-align:center;line-height:21px;">Obviously weather impacts the suitability of the environment for disease development, but it can also affect the survival and buildup of disease inoculum. Weather related stresses can also affect the susceptibility of a product to disease infection and/or development.</p>

											<p style="margin-top:30px;font-size:16px;text-align:center;line-height:21px;">Nitrogen in excess quantity can lead to overly lush canopy development thus contributing to a more favorable environment for disease development. Nitrogen stress can also affect the susceptibility of a product to disease.</p>

											<p style="margin-top:30px;font-size:16px;text-align:center;line-height:21px;">Selecting products with above average disease resistance ratings for important diseases in your fields can help reduce the development of those diseases in this year's corn crop. Product selection can also impact the buildup of disease inoculum that may be carried forward into subsequent years' corn crops.</p>

											<p style="margin-top:30px;font-size:16px;text-align:center;line-height:21px;">Growing corn after corn can lead to a greater buildup of pathogen inoculum to be carried forward from year to year. Rotating to a non-host crop can help mitigate this effect. The previous crop can also affect the suitability of the environment for disease development.</p>

											<p style="margin-top:30px;font-size:16px;text-align:center;line-height:21px;">Plant population affects the environment for disease development because it impacts the timing and density of canopy development and closure. As canopy density increases, air flow is generally reduced resulting in increased canopy moisture and a potentially more suitable environment for disease development.</p>

											<p style="margin-top:30px;font-size:16px;text-align:center;line-height:21px;">Tillage can help to warm and dry the soil prior to planting by breaking up and burying corn residue and thereby reduce the suitability of the soil environment for disease development. Sizing and burying corn residue can also reduce the buildup of some pathogens and may reduce inoculum available to infect the next corn crop.</p>
