<h2>User Interface Work</h2>

<p>UI work I've done over the years. Solely responsible for all HTML, CSS, and JS except for Acres Of Gold which I came in later and coverted it to responsive</p>

<p><b>Desktop UI (can click through for multiple views, JS is functional):</b>
dominicknorwood.com - http://dominicknorwood.com/unlocked.html
Odile_mocks - http://dominicknorwood.com/sites/odile_mocks/
le_kinkeliba_mocks - http://dominicknorwood.com/sites/le_kinkeliba_mocks/
marketdelta_mocks - http://dominicknorwood.com/sites/marketdelta_mocks/</p>

<p><b>Responsive UI:</b>
lelander - http://lelander.com/ (site animates its responsive layout)
lelander-expand-shrink - http://dominicknorwood.com/sites/lelander-expand-shrink/ (prototype of lelander site but if you click the 3 boxes in this version they expand and shrink showing more content inside)
acres-of-gold - http://www.aganytime.com/dekalb/tools/Pages/Acres-of-Gold.aspx</p>

<p><b>Mobile UI (can click through for multiple views):</b>
deltapine_mobile - http://dominicknorwood.com/sites/deltapine_mobile/
Monsanto_mobile - http://dominicknorwood.com/sites/monsanto_mobile/</p>

<p><b>JavaScript:</b>
jquery-slideshows - http://dominicknorwood.com/jquery_slideshows.html (old slideshows I produced with jquery need to be converted to OO)</p>
