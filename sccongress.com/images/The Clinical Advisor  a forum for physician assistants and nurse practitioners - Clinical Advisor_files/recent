Carolyn was misdiagnosed with acid reflux when she was experiencing a heart attack. She now has ongoing cardiovascular issues.\r\n\r\nSue's infant son was misdiagnosed as healthy when he was really experiencing brain damage from jaundice. He now has severe cerebral palsy.\r\n\r\nJeff was misdiagnosed with a heart attack. After he told his doctors his leg was swelling, they diagnosed him with a triple A aortic dissection, revising their initial diagnosis after listening to the patient's concerns.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit IOM's Report page at: nas.edu/improvingdiagnosis","review_fits":null,"media_item":{"MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Media::Object::Video","js_type":"Magnify.Media.Object.Video"},"media_type_cid":"video","pipeline_info":null,"nid":"257462473","posted":"2015-09-22 14:55:54","pipeline_xid":"fStBWT6fa3E","synced":"2015-09-23 11:20:33","poster":"Institute of Medicine","thumbnail_cache":"2","thumbnail_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fStBWT6fa3E/sddefault.jpg","description":"According to  the report Improving Diagnosis in Health Care, most of us will experience a diagnostic errorâ meaning an inaccurate or delayed diagnoses â in our lifetime.

Your cholesterol medication could be the cause.\n\nA new study found that women who take statins may be more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior, while men taking these medications may be less likely to be aggressive.\n\nâStatins donât affect all people equally â effects differ in men versus women and younger versus older,â wrote lead study author Beatrice A. Golomb, MD, from the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, and colleagues. âFemale sex and older age have predicted less favorable effects of statins on a number of other outcomes as well, including survival.â\n\nStatins are a widely-used class of drugs prescribed to maintain healthy cholesterol levels and lower heart disease risk.\n\nHowever, these medications can have side effects including changes in behavior and mood. Previous studies have found that statins may lead to irritability and violent reactions.\n\nDr. Golumb and team looked at the effects of statins on 1,000 men and postmenopausal women.\n\nAccording to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, all of these participants had LDL â sometimes known as bad cholesterol â levels in a range that is considered borderline in terms of healthiness (LDL levels greater than 115mg/dL but less than 190mg/dL).\n\nDr. Golumb and team randomly assigned these participants to take either a statin or a placebo over the course of six months. The statins used were either simvastatin (brand name Zocor) or pravastatin (Pravachol).\n\nThese researchers then measured behavioral aggression using a scale designed to evaluate aggressive acts. These acts included verbal assaults, assaults against objects, assaults against others and assaults against the self.\n\nAt the end of six months, Dr. Golumb and team found an increase in aggressive behavior among the postmenopausal women over age 45. However, an overall decrease in aggressive behavior was found among the men.\n\nThis increase in aggression also appeared stronger in women who began with lower aggression tendencies.","license":null,"media_equivalence_nid":null,"tags":"News & Politics, Health, News, Menopause (Disease Or Medical Condition), Statin (Drug Class), Aggression (Symptom), Hypertension (Disease Or Medical Condition), Cholesterol (Chemical Compound)","duration_seconds":"46","format_info":null,"media_pipeline_cid":"youtube","source_href":"http://youtu.be/smLhlq-V5B8","title":"Riled Up?

Researchers found that men who regularly turned in late had an increased risk of diabetes and women who did the same had an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, which is a cluster of conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, raised cholesterol levels and excess belly fat.\nMayo Clinic sleep expert Dr. Peter Gay says your body needs an average of 7 hours of good sleep a night, and that may be more important for your health than when you get it. He says research shows if you get a lot more or a lot less than 7 hours of sleep a night on a regular basis, your increase the risk of some cancers and heart disease. \n\nSo, Ben Franklin may have been on to something with that old saying of early to bed, early to rise.

The study is published in NeurologyÂ®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\nâOur goal is to identify people who are at the highest risk for dementia as early as possibleâ said study author Ronald Petersen, M.D., Ph.D., Chester and Debbie Cadieux Director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Cora Kanow Professor of Alzheimerâs Disease Research and a member of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\nâEarly detection of individuals at high risk of developing memory and thinking problems that we call mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is crucial because people with MCI are at a greater risk of developing dementia. This allows for a wider window of opportunity to initiate preventative measures.â\n\nThe study involved 1,449 randomly selected people from Olmsted County, Minnesota between the ages of 70 and 89 who did not have memory and thinking problems. At the start of the study and at visits every 15 months for an average of 4.8 years, participants were given memory and thinking tests. During the study, 401 people â nearly a third â developed MCI.\n\nThe scoring system took into account factors that could be easily obtained from medical records, such as years of education, number of medications, history of stroke or diabetes, and smoking. Researchers also factored in information obtained at the clinic visit, such as a test of thinking abilities, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and slow gait. Factors were assigned a score based on how much they contributed to the risk of developing thinking problems. For example, being diagnosed with diabetes before age 75 increased the risk score by 14 points, while having 12 or fewer years of education increased the risk by two points.\n\nMany predictive factors were different for men and women. While the risk of MCI increases with age overall, younger men were at a higher risk of developing MCI than younger women. Conversely, older women have a somewhat higher risk than older men.\n\nVariables such as age, diabetes, heart health risk factors, slow gait, depression and anxiety disorders, stand out as contributing most to the risk score. The APOE gene, which has been linked to a higher risk of dementia, was determined in the study to be only a moderate risk factor.\n\nâThis risk scale provides an inexpensive and easy way for doctors to identify people who should be referred to more advanced testing for memory issues or may be better candidates for clinical trials,â said Petersen.","license":null,"media_equivalence_nid":null,"tags":"Education, Mayo Clinic (Hospital), Alzheimer's Disease (Disease Or Medical Condition), Dementia (Disease Or Medical Condition), Health (Industry), Diagnosis (Literature Subject), testing, scoring","duration_seconds":"190","format_info":null,"media_pipeline_cid":"youtube","source_href":"http://youtu.be/kzhRhUxdwcg","title":"Mayo Clinic's Better Way to Test Dementia","cid":"W7QNL32GFV653Y9W"},"review_ente":null,"title":"A new scoring system to identify dementia risk","cid":"TPMJ9Y1LBYSGZPK0","replaced_nid":null,"user_login_nid":"4510304","review_reco":null,"nid":"415490749","permalink":"Mayo-Clinic-s-Better-Way-to-Tes","magnify_hosted":null,"views":"469","schedule_status":null,"large_thumbnail_url":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/magnifythumbs/W7QNL32GFV653Y9W-l.jpg","review_info":null,"content_status_cid":"filtered","review_score":null,"community_site_nid":"141264","approved":"2015-04-08 13:39:33","client_ip":null,"schedules":{},"review_audi":null},{"MagnifyMetaData":{"perl_type":"Magnify::Content::Item","js_type":"Magnify.Content.Item"},"scheduled":"0","review_count":null,"posted":"2015-04-03 13:44:42","view_count":"-1","user":{"handle":"Brianne","cid":"6G78HZ2486R07616"},"media_item_nid":"250212833","review_leng":null,"thumbnail_url":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/magnifythumbs/T3R1F31BZ57P3WQ8.jpg","scheduled_time":"2015-04-03 13:51:26","description":"Steven Lee, MD, of the Mattel Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles, provides an overview of the methods used to diagnose and treat pediatric appendicitis.
